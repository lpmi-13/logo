The file [sticker.svg](sticker.svg) is a vectorized version based on Annie's
original raster (PNG) files. The log raft and clouds were traced automatically
using Inkscape.  The sky was made slightly darker and more blue to increase
contrast with the "raft.github.io" text.  The font used is v1.x of
[Comfortaa](https://github.com/ongardie/Comfortaa/tree/master/v1.x)
(note that the *f* and *t* in 'raft' look different in v2.x).
